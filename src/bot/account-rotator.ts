/**
 * Auto-rotate-on-give-up. When a turn exhausts its retries (or fails immediately
 * with a permanent billing error like HTTP 402 balance exhausted) and auto-fork
 * can't recover it, the runtime can cycle through the OTHER saved Grok accounts,
 * retrying the same prompt on each — useful when the active account is
 * throttled, out of quota, or its backend keeps returning "dispatch failure".
 *
 * The rotation is bounded to a SINGLE pass over the saved accounts (no infinite
 * loop): each account is tried once; the first that succeeds wins and stays
 * active, otherwise the runtime reports the error gathered from every account.
 *
 * Account switching is process-global (one machine → one active Grok login), so
 * a rotation restarts the shared agent and affects every chat — intended, since
 * the whole point is to move everyone onto a working login.
 *
 * CRITICAL: every activate() MUST fully restart the CLI so the new auth applies:
 *   1. stop agent (`stopAndWait`) — process must exit so it cannot rewrite auth,
 *   2. replace ~/.grok/auth.json with the saved snapshot,
 *   3. start agent + `authenticate({ methodId: "cached_token" })` headlessly.
 * Never opens a browser / never runs `grok login`.
